# VrbStarterKit
The VrbStarterKit is a pre implemented project with util features for PHP projects that uses the raw PHP programming concept. This kit includes a collections of services, utilities, deafult patterns, configurations and pre defined plugins. 

## Installation
To start to use this kit, download or clone this repository in your project diretory. After it, turn on the server and try to access the index.php from any browser. If you get it, your kit installation is finished. If the access gets bad, or some redirect error gets occured, please check the **config.php** file and put the correct configuration in thepre defined keys. Try again and success! Check the section below for configuring instructions. 

## Configuration
When you start the project, the **config.php** file needs to be configured according with project definitions. Some configurations as the title, key-words, responsivity, access data for database, base url, etc... need to be defined correctly. We recommend much to clone this file with production configuration (example: <b>productionConfig.php</b>), and change to the correct config file when the application gets up to prodution environment. 

> The <b>MATERIAL_DESIGN</b> is about the CSS framework kind you will use. By default, the bootstrap is set to the project, but you can change it to use the Material Design if you want. If you chose the material design, some util components can stop to work, and these components need to be reimplemented.

> The <b>IDIOM</b> configuration can be defined in the configuration file based on the files inside the **/app/translates** directory. If there is a session parameter configured in the <b>$_SESSION['IDIOM']</b>, this configuration will be used as priority and the file that will be used will be the specified file for this key value.

## Patterns
The project uses camel case for any identifier. Every default PHP resources are in the <b>/app</b> folder.
The files use a suffix to define the kind of this file. The table below shows these definitions:

Suffix|Location|Description
---|---|---
`Page`|/app/pages|PÃ¡ginas
`Service`|/app/services|Default functionalities collection
`Types`|/app/types|Constants collection
`Action`|/app/actions|Form actions
`Ajax`|/app/ajax|Return services for ajax requests
`Component`|/app/componentes|Components
`Cron`|/app/crons|Cron jobs implementations
`Repository`|/app/repositories|Manager services for database entities
`Template`|/app/templates|Any template type
`Css`|/app/styles|Cascade Stylesheets (CSS)
`Js`|/app/scripts|Scripts with algorithms (JS)
`Eula`|/app/eulas|Files with software policy
`Sql`|/app/sqls|Query language files (SQL)

## Services
The services are default functionalities for usage. There are different kinds of services that can be used for specified thing. Check the table below for more details:

Service|Definition
---|---
`Base64Service`|Operations to encode and decode files input with Base64
`DatabaseService`|Database connection service
`HeaderService`|HTTP header manipulation

## Imports
Any application imports are made using the `ImportService`, except by specified imports. This service is about to make imports files such CSS files, JS files, PHP files, etc. This service reads the application folders to import the files. You can use `Ignore_` key as file prefix to prevent to load this file by the service. Below are some important functions that will import common files to the application:  

Method|Definition
---|---
importCssModules()|Function to import CSS files using the tag: ```<link href="" />```
importJsModules()|Function to import JS files using the tag: ```<script src=""></script>```
importPhpModules()|Function to import PHP files using the method: ```require_once() ```

> The function ```ImportService::importPhpModules() ``` imports any PHP file from the folders <b>/app/components</b>, <b>/app/types</b>, <b>/app/repositories</b> e <b>/app/services</b>. The file <b>/config.php</b> is imported too. Files that have the prefix <b>ignore_</b> willbe ignored for importation.

## Components
There is an interface for component creation. This interface has 3 default methods. Each method is defined for a specified thing:

Method|Definition
---|---
html|Render component's html
script|Render component's script
style|Render component's style
render|Render component

A component is a PHP object, that has the renderization changed by the configured attributes. Check the example below for component creation:

```php
$component = new WelcomeComponent("VrbStarterKit");
$component->render();
```

## Repositories
The Repository classes are for database entity manipulation. The interface allows 5 methods to implementation. The interface implementation is not required. It is just a base content to help Repository classes implementation.

Method|Definition
---|---
get($id)|Get an object from database with specified ID
list($filtros)|List some objects from database with specified filter
insert($dados)|Insert an object entity to database
delete($id)|Delete an object entity from database
update($id, $dados)|Update the object identified by the informed id with new data

## Crons
Cron classes have just an execution method to be called by cron jobs from server or other source. 

## Pages
The application pages follows a design pattern. Check below for an example: 

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . "/../services/ImportService.php");
ImportService::importPhpModules();

// Page event
EventService::page();
?>
<html>
    <head>
        <?php
        HtmlService::title("Title");
        HtmlService::metatags();
        HtmlService::favicon();
        ImportService::importCssModules();
        ImportService::importJsModules();
        ?>
    </head>
    <body>
        <?php 
            // TODO
        ?>
    </body>
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function () {

        });
    </script>
</html>
```
